Boot Mode Types: Cisco Nexus switches can boot from different sources such as a specific boot image file (bootflash:), a boot loader (loader:), or even from a remote location via TFTP (tftp:) or a network server (dhcp:).  
Native Boot: When you see "native" in the output of the "show boot mode" command, it indicates that the switch is set to boot from its default or primary boot location. This is often bootflash: by default, which refers to the onboard flash memory where the operating system image is stored.  
Other Options: Apart from "native," the output might also list other configured boot options if they have been defined. These could include specific files or directories where boot images are stored, such as bootflash:filename or bootflash:/directory/filename, depending on how the boot variables are configured.
