## Security Management Server Software Blades

- Network Policy Management — to create and manage SG security policies
- Endpoint Policy Management — to create and manage Endpoint Security Policies
- Logging & Status – central logging and log consolidation functionality
- Workflow — Change Management Cycle functionality with ability to audit and approve certain policy management operations
- User Directory — User management and integration with external authentication solutions
- Provisioning — Centralized maintenance tool
- Compliance — Automated compliance tool for security and best practices audits
- SmartEvent — Log correlation and Security Events management tool

## Concepts 

- R80 layers
- Access policy can work in inline mode for layers or in ordered mode
- If acceleration is on, fw monitor sees only syn
- Before connecting smart console we configure via https: interfaces, routes, time, installation type, sic phrase
- cpconfig
- Multi domain manager contains management servers inside itself
- PLus we can install separate logging servers
- Multi domain server can be management or logging
- Management multi-domain server contains inside Domain Management Servers
- Logging multi-domain server contains Domain Log servers
- ClusterXL provides a method for high traffic volumes to be intelligently spread across multiple gateways
- SecureXL provides acceleration for multiple, intensive security operations by offloading the handling of those operations and acting as a director to distribute the traffic to remaining cores
- CoreXL distributes IPS inspection to run in parallel on multi-core processor systems
- Smart update - keep OS, patches, licenses current
- Central license is better than local one

Ports

- TCP 256 Manager > Gateway
- TCP 257 Gateway > Log server
- Client authentication daemon listens:
- 259 - telnet
- 900 - http
- Check Point uses a proprietary protocol to test if VPN tunnels are active, and supports any site-to-site VPN configuration. Tunnel testing requires two Security Gateways, and uses UDP port 18234. Check Point tunnel testing protocol does not support 3rd party Security Gateways
- SmartUpdate to User center - 443
- R80 Smart Console to manager:
- 19009
- 18190
- 18264

Rule processing order

- Anti-spoofing checks
- First Implicit Rules
- Explicit Rules (except for the final rule)
- Before Last Implicit Rules
- Last Explicit Rule (should be cleanup rule)
- Last Implicit Rules
- Network Address Translation

Rule types:

- management - configure who can connect to firewall
- stealth - deny all direct connections to firewall
- internal - if we want to permit everything from 1 particular user
- cleanup - deny everything, used for logging of denied traffic
- many implied rules

History

- First product - Firewall 1
- Than VPN-1
- Devised stateful inspection

SMART architecture
Security management architecture
Console, Management and gateway

Policy is stored on management server and pushed to all gateways
For good performance it is recomended to use Auto NAT instead of Manual

Application awareness

Operating systems:

- IPSO - based on BSD, deprecated
- SecurePlatform - SPLAT - based on Redhat
- GAiA - since 2012, the latest one

SmartEvent requires

- Correlation Unit
- Server
- Client

Versions of firewall itself:

- R61
- R62
- R65
- R70
- R71
- R75
- R76
- R77
- R80

Checkpoint calls stateful inspection - INSPECT engine
Logs to third party can be provided via LEA - Log Export Api

**NAT order**

- Manual - pre automatic NAT
- Automatic static NAT
- Automatic Hide NAT
- Post automatic/Manual NAT

SRC NAT is done on server side
DST NAT is done on client side

When we create Hide NAT it works only when source from inside is trying to connect to destination outside, not vice versa.
When we create automatic static nat it works in both directions.

**Authentication in firewall rules**

- User authentication - can be configured only for HTTP, FTP, HTTPS, rlogin, Telnet. Very intrusive, is not applied first in rule base
- Session authentication - requires agent, does not fit for HTTP because HTTP creates many sessions.
- Client authentication - per IP address, after auth rules are allowed for this IP

**Daemons**

- cprid - upgrade operations - listen on Gateway for connections from Management server
- cpd (Checkpoint Daemon) - core process: SIC functionality(port18xxx), licenses operations, listen on Gateway for connections from Management server, transfer messages between processes, policy installation, pull the application monitoring status from the GW/Management using Smart Event
- pdp and pep - Identity awareness
- confd - provides access to GAIA configuration database
- fwm (Firewall management) - available on all managament servers: if smartdashboard login fails, gui client communication, database manipulation, policy compilation, management HA sync
- fwd - allows other processes to forward logs to external log server, responsible for other security processes, responsible for full sync in ClusterXL, responsible for kernel tables info across cluster memebers
- fw kernel - responsible for delta sync in Cluster XL
- cpwd - checkpoint watchdog
- fwssd - child process of fwd, maintain SMS, maintain security servers
- cplmd - starts when Smartview tracker starts
- vpnd - authenticates IPSec vpn users
- cvpnd - SSL VPN
- snd - secure network distributor - process incoming traffic and distributes among kernel instances
- gated - manages dynamic routing protocols
- fw gen - compiles $FWDIR/conf/*.W files into machine language

**Configuration files**

- $FWDIR/conf/fwauthd.conf - security server configuration
- $FWDIR/conf/fwauth.NDB - user definition
- $FWDIR/conf/vpn_route.conf - VPN routing
- ike.elg - log file about negotiation encryption
- vpnd.elg - verbose info about vpn failures
- $RTDIR/distrib and $RTDIR/events_db - all system events
- $RTDIR/Database/conf/my.cnf - Smart Reporter database settings in Linux
- %RTDIR%\Database\conf\my.ini - in Windows

## VPN AD CA certificate

- Gateway options > IPSec VPN > Import certificate
- Gateway options > VPN Clients > Authentication > certificate
- Gateway options > VPN Clients > gateway authenticates with certificate....
- Gateway options > Mobile Access > Authentication > certificcate
- Manage > OPsec > New CA
- Manage > Opsec >  new LDAP account unit

done < nets2

echo "update_all" >> add_net
echo "savedb" >> add_net
```

## Script add hosts

Make sure that there are no spaces, no objects start with a number, no dublicates and end of line is in Linux format

```bash
#! /bin/bash
rm add_ip
while read line
do
echo $line
name=`echo $line | cut -d";" -f 1`
ip=`echo $line | cut -d";" -f 2`
comment=`echo $line | cut -d";" -f 3`

echo "create host_plain $name" >> add_ip
echo "modify network_objects $name ipaddr $ip" >> add_ip
if [ -n "$comment" ]
then
echo "modify network_objects $name comments $comment" >> add_ip
fi

done < hosts

echo "update_all" >> add_ip
echo "savedb" >> add_ip
```

And then

`dbedit -globallock -f add_ip`

## VSX

Benefits

- Reduce Hardware expenses
- Simplify management
- Expand and scale network environment
- Centralized provision of security gateways

Two modes

- Routing
- Bridge - exclude VPN and NAT

Every VS has its own

- Network
- Inspect engine
- Kernel 
- Configuration
- Policy
- SIC
- File handling
- CP registry

Virtual components include:

- Security Gateways
- Routers
- Switches
- Cables

4 types of links:

- warp links - direct connection, created automatically, for example between VS and virtual router. On VS side it has prefix wrp. On virtual switch side it has prefix wrpj. Virtual mac is automatically created.
- Virtual (VLAN) interfaces - used to connect to external switch with tags
- Physical interfaces
- Unnumbered interfaces - The following limitations apply to Unnumbered Interfaces:
	- Unnumbered interfaces must connect to a Virtual Router.
	- You can only "borrow" an individual interface IP address once.
	- In order to use VPN or Hide NAT, the borrowed address must be routable.

Virtual Systems support:

- OSPF
- RIP
- BGP
- PIM

Virtual System Load Sharing (VSLS)

- For example, Active Virtual System 1 runs on VSX Cluster Member A, while Active Virtual System 2 runs on VSX Cluster Member B

Deployment strategies

- Physical Internal Interface for Each Virtual System
- Virtual Systems with Internal VLAN Interfaces
- Internal Virtual Router with Source-Based Routing
- Virtual Systems in Bridge Mode

Concepts

- 64 per virtual system, 128 max  interfaces
- 4096 interfaces per VSX gateway
- Virtual Systems can be managed by  different  Domain Management Servers
- Remote management connects via a Virtual System are not supported
- Non-DMI is irreversible - you cannot change from a non-DMI VSX Gateway to a DMI VSX Gateway
- When you create a Virtual Device, VSX automatically establishes SIC trust using the secure communication channel defined between the Management Server and the VSX Gateway
- The VSX Gateway uses its management interface for Secure Internal Communication between the Management Server and all Virtual Devices.
- Routes are automatically added to virtual systems from adjacent virtual systems
- Virtual switch can have only one interface
- In VS we can change only interface and VLAN
- Two modes of management are available: Direct management  interface and non direct.  vsx_util_reconfigure command is not  available during non direct. 
- Route propagation to adjacent  virtual devices is available for physical interfaces  and is configured in topology section of virtual system
- Bonding groups and management interface must be configured before converting gateway to VSX
- wrpj interfaces represent the Virtual Router/Switch side of the connection
- wrp interfaces represent system side of the connection

You can jump to any virtual device (Gateway, router, switch) with vsenv command using ID:

```
vsenv 2
ifconfig
```

Cluster

- We prepare 2 devices: configure networks and HA interfaces
- No IP addresses on phisical interfaces
- VSX license on each gateway
- Then we configure IP for VSX cluster
- And install policy on cluster - it controls traffic to cluster itself

Deployment process

1. The management server stops its current operations to deploy the Virtual System.
2. The target Virtual System’s object receives an update.
3. The Virtual System sends its configuration changes to the management server.
4. The management server pushes out the Virtual System configuration changes to the physical VSX Gateway (VS0).
5. The target Virtual System (VS1 and above) receives its network configuration script (local.vsall.files).

Disable VSX mode

```
set virtual-system 0
set vsx off
show vsx
```

Maximum amount of concurent connections in VSX

```
vsx_1 (X80): [vs0] root$ vsx stat -v -l

<output removed>
Connections number: 0
Connections peak: 0
Connections limit: 15000 (this is the value configured in the GUI)
```

Reset gateway deleting all virtual sytems

```
reset_gw
```

Virtual switch


We create it, specify physical interfaces to which it is connected, can also specify VLAN.
Delete virtual switch on management server

```
vsx_provisioning_tool -s localhost -u admin -p 123qwe -o remove vd name VS2
```

Virtual System

We create it and assign interfaces to it, and provide IP addresses for them also we may send routes to other virtual systems.
We also configure default route.
We create a separate policy for every virtual system and install it.
Configure dinamic routing:

```
set virtual-system <Virtual system ID>
commands to enable dynamic routing
save config
```

In this case it is better to disable automatic topology calculation

```

and then make sure the process is dead

```
mdsstat
```

## Troubleshooting

- `cphaprob stat`  > with more clusterxl informations
- `fwaccel ranges`  > show's anti spoofing ranges
- `fw ctl multik utilize`  > shows the CoreXL queue utilization for each CoreXL FW instance
- `fw ctl multik print_heavy_conn` > shows the table with heavy connections
- `cpinfo -y all` - Show all hotfixes installed
- `fwaccel stat` - Check if SecureXL is enabled - This command also shows if Drop Templates are enabled. Drop templates accelerate drops with Secure XL. If you have many drops, it may help.
- `$CPDIR/log/cpwd.elg` - cpd daemon does not work, 18191 port does not listen, policy cannot be pushed
- During the tracert Checkpoint replies with interface address of Cluster, not from the address of 1 particular fw
- `fw ctl zdebug + drop | grep 1.1.1.1` - See all dropped connections and more importantly the reason (e.g. anti-spoofing, IPS , FW rule)
- `cpstat fw` - Quickly see stats of number of connections (accepted,denied,logged) with a breakdown
- Capture traffic

```
fw monitor | grep 1.1.1.1
fw monitor -e 'accept host(75.154.130.239) and host(100.70.184.5);
fw monitor -e 'accept host(100.66.100.16) and udpport(69);'
fw monitor -e "accept;" -o capture.pcap
tcpdump -s 0 -nn -w capture.pcap -i bond2.340 host 192.168.180.19 and port 443
```

- `cpview; show sysenv all; show asset` -  hardware
- `fw ctl chain` - Shows inbound and outbound chains
- `cpwd_admin list; cpwd_admin stop -name FWM` - Control watch dog and processes
- `vpn crl_zap` - Erase all CRLs
- `fw accel off` - Turn off SecureXL
- `fw ctl pstat` - Gather statistics about the connections
- `fw tab -t connections -s` - Show amount of connections
- Hold table issues: Issue description: traffic is silently dropped, and fw ctl zdebug + drop shows the following: `dropped by fw_filter_chain Reason: chain hold failed;`
- `fw tab -t hold_table -s` - Show state of hold table
- `fw ctl get int fwhold_limit` - Show hold table limit
- To solve this issue we need to increase hold limit, install policy, and optimize policy: all access role rules to the bottom

## Smart event + logging

You can deploy SmartEvent in these ways:
- As part of the SmartEvent – A renewable one year license is included with the SmartEvent
package
- As a dedicated server – You can purchase a perpetual license for a SmartEvent Server

Three modes in Smarttracker:
- Log
- Active
- Audit - super detail

Many predefined quieries + you can create custom
Logs are stored: /$FWDIR/log
Smartlog searches all logs, tracker only fw.log
By default firewall does not store logs by itself, it sends them to management server, but we can configure it manually
Email alerts, SNMP traps
We can block people right from SmartTracker
We also have Smartlog and Smart reporter to deal with many log files simultaneously 
Smarttracker watches only on current log file
Active mode in Smarttracker overloads system

See where firewall sends logs, on firewall itself: `netstat -an | grep 257`

Search logs in multidomain

```
mdsenv mobility.dls
mcd log

fw log -ftnlp | grep <ip>
fw monitor -e 'accept host(172.23.96.71);'
```

Syslog

- Earlier OPSEC and LEA were used.
- Now Log Exporter is primarly used. It is integrated into system since R80.10.
- Filtering based on fields is supported but only from certain versions in 80.20 and 80.30.

## VPN

Steps:

- Enable on Gateway
- ID DOmain
- Create community
- Add rules

Community members - firewalls themselves
Domains -  local networks behind firewalls
VPN site = domain + member

vpn tu - toll on firewall itself to manage VPNs
Domain based takes precedence over route based
Communities may be star or full mesh.

Remote access
- Which addresses will clients get - `Gateway options > VPN clients > Office mode > manual Using pool`
- When using Office Mode, a special IKE mode called config mode is inserted between phase 1 and phase 2 of IKE. During config mode, the client requests an IP from the Security Gateway. Several other parameters are also configurable this way, such as a DNS server IP address, and a WINS server IP address
- A remote user with SecuRemote only is not supported in Office Mode
- IPSec is used with NAT-T: ESP is encapsulated into UDP port 4500
- UDP 4500 and TCP 443 are always used for RA VPN

MEP
- MEP gateways are not restricted to geography
- They can be managed by different management servers
- VPN client selects the secondary gateway
- MEP VPNs use proproetary Probing Protocol (PP) to send special UDP RDP packets to port 259

Troubleshooting

```
vpn debug on > check $FWDIR/log/ike.elg, vpnd.elg
```

Verify that all tunnels are established
```
vpn tunnelutil
```

Verify that configured properly - `vpn shell show interface detailed <VTI name>`

Wire mode
- Allows traffic to pass without any inspection from trusted sources to trusted sources. Based on routed VPN.
- Enabed on Gateway or on Comminity

## Sandblast

- Обязательная лицензия NGTX
- Ставится на шлюз или на саму песочницу если она работает одна без шлюза Чекпоинта
- Threat Extraction - присылает пользователю пдфку вместо файла или просто пустой файл - без задержек - это же поддерживается в агенте
- Агент все отправляет в облако
- Агент постоянно собирает кучу информации локально, если срабатывает триггер, то агент сгенерит мега отчет о том откуда что и как пришло, для логов нужен 1 гиг
- Краковременные бекапы - 1 гб, для защиты от шифровальщиков, сразу после запуска шифровальщика агент определяет это, восстанавливает файлы из бэкапа, и блочит шифровальщика и создает отчет для расследования
- Самый полный агент - это Checkpoint Endpoint Security - в него все входит включая сандбласт агент

For pilot we need 

1. Management server
2. AD server
3. Couple of VMs with agents
4. Take snapshot of al VMs at one time
5. Acess to VMs via RDP without buffer or VMware client
6. Do not integrate with local Sandblast device

Good for TLS 1.3 and GOST as no need decryption

Anti bot modes:
1. Detect and alert
2. Hold and prevent
Antibot on agent does support inspection of encrypted traffic, or works only with http and IPs

Antifishing starts analyzing a page only after you click on input field
openphish.com
Smartendpoint console program
Gui dbedit is often used
Agent does not support proxy at all

## Optimization

- Firewall policy: Rules with access roles in the very bottom
- Firewall policy: top hit hit rules in the top
- HTTPS policy: rules with categories in the very bottom, as minimum rules as possible
- HTTPS policy: access roles rules can damage whole policy, use with care
- Delete log files base on percentage, not megabytes
- Smartevent correlation unit should be on a log server
- Sandblast policy should contain only threatemulation blade
- Threat prevention rules should be minimum

## Threat prevention

- Threat prevention policy uses multi match approach, where traffic is matched against all rules in all layers
- You can use layers for different protection scopes
- Different admins can work with difeerent layers
- We can use speicific layer for specific blade

Threat Prevention Layers enforcement is calculated by the following:

- Each layer has a first-match logic. Once a match is found, processing is done at the other layers.
- Unlike Access Control, there is no requirement for clean-up rule. So if there is no match on a layer, assumption is that no threat prevention inspection is needed.
- In case there are multiple threat prevention layers, and a match was found in several layers, the strictest option matters. So if you chose to prevent a protection for a subnet in the first layer but detect that protection in another layer, it will be in prevent

Search for emulated cab files from microsoft.com in Logs in R80.10

```
blade:"Threat Emulation" AND file_name:*.cab AND *microsoft.com*
```

Troubleshooting:

Collect logs `$FWDIR/log/cpm.elg*`
`$FWDIR/log/install_policy.elg*`

If it's IPS update failure, run debug

```
fw debug fwm on TDERROR_ALL_ALL=5
```

Run update, disable debug

```
fw debug fwm off
```

## Secure XL

- Performance pack uses SecureXL technology to accelerate traffic
- Implemented in software
- Drop Template - Feature that accelerates the speed, at which a connection is dropped by matching a new connection to a set of attributes. When a new connection matches the Drop Template, subsequent connections are dropped without performing a rule match and therefore are accelerated. Currently, Drop Template acceleration is performed only on connections with the same destination port.
- Accelerated path - Packet flow when the packet is completely handled by the SecureXL device. It is processed and forwarded to the network.
- Firewall path / Slow path (F2F) - Packet flow when the SecureXL device is unable to process the packet (refer to sk32578 - SecureXL Mechanism). The packet is passed on to the CoreXL layer and then to one of the Core FW instances for full processing. This path also processes all packets when SecureXL is disabled.

## Inspection points

- 1st - i – Pre-inbound - rule/inspection is applied at this point
- 2nd - I – Post-inbound - after being permitted by the rule/inspections
- 3rd - o – Pre-outbound - route look up has been performed to determine the egress interface
- 4th - O – Post-outbound - after egressing the correct firewall interface based on route lookup

The vast majority of firewall security operations (and possible drops) happen on the inbound/client side of the firewall kernel between "i" and "I" such as:

- Inbound Anti-spoofing
- Geo Policy
- HTTPS/VPN decryption
- Connections state table lookups
- Access Control policy layer evaluation
- Destination IP NAT
- Threat Prevention policy layer evaluation

Between "I" and "o" the Gaia IP driver performs routing.

Between "o" and "O" on the outbound/server side of the firewall kernel, the following types of operations occur:

- Outbound Anti-spoofing
- HTTPS/VPN encryption
- Source IP NAT

## NAT

- It is possible to configure 2 NAT ruls wich match a connection, but only when using Automatic NAT (bidirectional NAT)

## BGP

- Restrict sending routes to peer from which we got these routes and redistribute one directly connected network
- Allow all other routes to be exported and imported

```

## Core XL

- CoreXL is a Check Point technology that allows firewall and IPS security code to run on multiple processors/cores concurrently
- The CoreXL layer accelerates traffic that cannot be handled by the SecureXL device or traffic that requires deep packet inspection
- CoreXL is able to provide near linear scalability of performance, based on the number of processing cores on a single machine 
- This increase in performance is achieved without requiring any changes to management or network topology
- In a CoreXL gateway, the firewall kernel is replicated so that each replicated copy (instance) runs on a processing core. These instances handle traffic concurrently, and each instance is a complete and independent inspection kernel
- CoreXL improves performance with almost linear scalability in the following scenarios:
    - Much of the traffic can not be accelerated by SecureXL
    - Many IPS features enabled, which disable SecureXL functionality
    - Large rulebase
    - NAT rules
- The CoreXL software architecture includes the Secure Network Distributor (SND). The SND is responsible for:
    - Processing incoming traffic from the network interfaces
    - Securely accelerating authorized packets (if SecureXL is running)
    - Distributing non-accelerated packets or Medium Path packets among CoreXL FW kernel instances - this functionality is also referred to as dispatcher
- The dispatcher is executed when a packet should be forwarded to a CoreXL FW instance (in Slow path and Medium path - see sk98737 for details) and is in charge of selecting the CoreXL FW instance that will inspects the packet
- In R77.20 and lower versions, traffic distribution between CoreXL FW instances is statically based on Source IP addresses, Destination IP addresses, and the IP 'Protocol' type. Therefore, there are possible scenarios where one or more CoreXL FW instances would handle more connections, or perform more processing on the packets forwarded to them, than the other CoreXL FW instances.
- This may lead to a situation, where the load is not balanced across the CPU cores, on which the CoreXL FW instances are running
- To help mitigate the above issue, CoreXL Dynamic Dispatcher feature was introduced in R77.30 Security Gateway.
- The new dynamic assignment mechanism is based on the utilization of CPU cores, on which the CoreXL FW instances are running
- R77.30 - To check the current mode on Security Gateway: `[Expert@HostName]# fw ctl multik get_mode`
- Enable: `[Expert@HostName]# fw ctl multik set_mode 9`
- In R80 is enabled by default
- Show: `[Expert@R80.10:0]# fw ctl multik dynamic_dispatching get_mode`
- Current mode is On
- Enable: `[Expert@HostName]# fw ctl multik dynamic_dispatching on`
- Change number of firewall instances: cpconfig, reboot required
- CoreXL will not improve performance in the following scenarios:
    - SecureXL accelerates much of the traffic
    - Traffic mostly consists of VPN
    - Traffic mostly consists of VoIP
- Affinity - Association of a particular network interface / FW kernel instance / daemon with a CPU core (either 'Automatic' (default), or 'Manual')
- Note: The default CoreXL interface affinity setting for all interfaces is 'Automatic' when SecureXL is installed and enable
- You can configure the number of firewall kernel instances (fw_worker) on a on a multi-core Check Point gateway via 'cpconfig'
- Show status and connection table for each core:`fw ctl multik stat`
- When configuring the CoreXL in 'cpconfig' menu, the configuration is saved in the /etc/fw.boot/boot.conf file
- Number of CoreXL FW instances must be identical on all members of the cluster because the state synchronization between members is performed per CoreXL FW instance
- Traffic is processed by the CoreXL FW instances only when the traffic is not accelerated by SecureXL
- VPN and VoIP are not load balanced with CoreXL and always handled by the same FW instance.
- Multi-queue lets you configure more than one traffic queue for each network interface. This means more than one CPU can be used for acceleration.
